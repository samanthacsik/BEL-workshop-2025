Deliverables: 

- written outline of your data story
- a sketch or concept of a supporting data visualization

Why storytelling?

Communicating via stories has been found to:

- Increase likelihood of people remembering information
- Reduce disbelief and counter-arguing
- Make people feel the experience as if it was their own
- Be much more convincing than just data or code
- Increase engagement with a more general audience

- “…the very act of telling a story makes people trust you more… Data doesn’t change behavior, emotions do” (-Karen Eber in her TED talk, Why storytelling is more trustworthy than presenting data)
- 3% of people will walk away from here remembering a stat, 68% of people will remember the story"; "stories create action"; "people act on the back of stories, whereas stats are just stale" (-Mike Bugembe in his TED talk, Lies, racism and sexism: The power of data stories)

---

Part 1: Define your "why"

1. What is your research question? (*I'm exploring..."*)
2. Why does this research matter? What information gap is this filling? (*This is important because...*)
3. What is one interesting finding or pattern in your data? (*Something surprising we've found is...*)
4. Who is impacted by this issue? (*This affects...*)
  
---

Part 2: Audience + Message

1. Who is your target audience?
  - e.g. policy makers, scientists, the general public, local community members
  
2. What do you want them to understand, feel, or do?
  - raise awareness, support a policy, shift perspective

3. What background context will your audience need?
  - *Before I show them the data, I need to explain...*
  
---

Part 3: Outline your story

---

Part 4: Sketch a data viz

*You may have a number of data sets and interesting findings. Focus on just one for this exercise.*

<!-- [Learning objectives]{.slide-title} -->

<!-- (5 min) -->

<!-- - storytelling is so important for connecting audiences with data -->
<!--   - makes data meaningful, actionable (use quotes / TED talk clips from [EDS 240 slide](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/course-materials/lecture-slides/lecture9.1-data-stories-slides.html#/why-storytelling)) -->
<!-- - today, we'll consider  -->
<!--   - what is data storytelling -->
<!--   - what can it look like (in the environmental sciences) -->
<!--   - begin crafting your own data stories based on your BEL research projects -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- [What is data storytelling?]{.slide-title} -->

<!-- - communicating insights from data using narratives and visualizations -->
<!--   - in environmental science? using data to create compelling narratives about environmental issues -->
<!-- - anytime we present data, we have the opportunity to tell a story -->
<!-- - three key elements:  -->
<!--   - add context: make it relevant / mean something for *your* audience, narrative, visuals (data viz) -->

<!-- - different mediums (standalone data viz, oral talks, academic journal articles, blogs / popsci or creative writing) -- all require a clear narrative to connect with your intended audience -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- [Discussion - crafting a story premise]{.slide-title} -->

<!-- (15 min) -->

<!-- Individually  -->
<!-- - what is your research question? -->
<!-- - what data are you working with? -->
<!-- - brainstorm the following:  -->
<!--   - who are the characters? -->
<!--   - what is main conflict or challenge? -->
<!--   - what insights do the data provide> -->
<!--   - what action do you want to inspire? -->

<!--   With a partner:  -->
<!--   - share your responses -->

Deliverable: an outlined data story based on your BEL research project 

---

Need to understand:

- **what** is data storytelling?
- **why** is it important? for environmental scientists?
- **how** do you approach crafting a data story?

---

**what** is data storytelling?

- communicating insights from data using compelling narratives and visualizations

---

**why** is it important? 

- “…the very act of telling a story makes people trust you more… Data doesn’t change behavior, emotions do” (-Karen Eber in her TED talk, Why storytelling is more trustworthy than presenting data)
- 3% of people will walk away from here remembering a stat, 68% of people will remember the story"; "stories create action"; "people act on the back of stories, whereas stats are just stale" (-Mike Bugembe in his TED talk, Lies, racism and sexism: The power of data stories)

(use quotes / TED talk clips from [EDS 240 slide](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/course-materials/lecture-slides/lecture9.1-data-stories-slides.html#/why-storytelling))

---

<!-- **how** do you approach crafting a data story -->

1. who is this for? define your intended **audience** (e.g. domain experts / researchers, policy makers, general public)
2. what do you want them to know / feel / do?
3. how will you show and tell them?

<!-- 2. consider your **narrative** -->
<!-- 3. build your **visuals** -->
<!-- 4. **highlight takeaways** -->

--- 

some examples here:

- academic journal article
- slide-based presentation
- static viz
- interactive dashboard
- scrollable story example

what made this effective?

----


---

old stuff here

---

[audience]{.slide-title}

- which story is interesting for them?
- what are the relevant details to include?
- which variables are meaningful to them?
- how will they encounter this information? e.g. data viz (online, in print, etc), oral talk, academic journal article, blog / creative writing?

---

[narrative]{.slide-title}

- what is the problem or information gap?
- how does your work aim to solve that problem / fill that information gap?
- 

---

[visuals]{.slide-title}

- consider data types (include [allison's art](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/course-materials/lecture-slides/lecture2.1-choosing-graphic-forms-slides.html#/cat-disc2))
- use decision tree: [from data to viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)
- but also don't limit yourself to just these options!

---

[highlight takeaways]{.slide-title}

- colors 
  - highlight groups / data points of interest
  - consider how colors convey information e.g. [Colors in Culture](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/colours-in-cultures/)
- typefaces / visual hierarchy
- annotations
- images
